## Hi there 👋

Welcome! 👋 I’m a backend developer focused on building scalable, resilient systems that are designed to grow and adapt with evolving business needs. This repository highlights my work and exploration into event sourcing, a powerful architectural pattern that rethinks how we manage state and data in distributed applications.

Rather than storing just the current state of data, I’ve been diving into the benefits of capturing every change as a sequence of events—allowing systems to become more auditable, flexible, and reactive. I’m especially interested in how event sourcing can enhance scalability, simplify debugging, and enable powerful features like temporal queries and real-time processing.

In this repo, you'll find practical implementations, proof-of-concept services, and utility libraries focused on event-driven architecture. I'm experimenting with tools and technologies that support high throughput and fault tolerance, and I'm continuously learning how to design systems that are both robust and easy to reason about.

Some of the areas I’m working on include command and event modeling, snapshot strategies, and integrating event stores with modern frameworks. I also explore patterns like CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and how it complements event sourcing for read-write separation and performance optimization.

The goal is to create reusable, maintainable backend services that scale naturally with user demand while keeping the codebase clean and testable. If you’re into distributed systems, event-driven design, or backend architecture in general, I’d love to hear your thoughts or collaborate.

Thanks for visiting—feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out. Let’s keep pushing backend development forward. ⚙️📡🚀
